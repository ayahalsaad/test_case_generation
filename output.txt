1.0 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY 

The Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT HQ) is responsible for the management of the state 
transportation capital program funding across various modal administrations.  MDOT HQ and the 
various modal administrations currently use the Capital Program Management System (CPMS) to 
manage and report their capital program. 

CPMS is a series of Microsoft Access databases consisting of SQL statements and macros that control 
calculations, queries, reports, and other functionality.  MDOT HQ is responsible for the management of 
CPMS through a maintenance contract with Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC).  MDOT HQ inputs 
data and extracts data from CPMS to compile quarterly reports.  Each quarter a Comprehensive Work 
Schedule (CWS) document is prepared.  The 1st quarter a draft Consolidated Transportation Program 
(CTP) report is created and the 3rd quarter a final Consolidated Transportation Program (CTP) report is 
created from data provided from each transportation mode.   

The following modal administrations are represented in the CWS, draft CTP, and final CTP:   

Maryland Port Administration (MPA) 
Maryland Aviation Administration (MAA) 
Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) 
Maryland State Highway Administration (SHA) 
Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) 
Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) 
Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA)  
Transportation Secretary’s Office (TSO) 

The modes provide MDOT HQ with data that is used in the creation of the CWS, draft CTP, and the final 
CTP.  Additionally, many modes use CPMS for the day-to-day management of their capital program to 
monitor and track project cash flow, status, and schedules. 

CPMS was created by contract developers associated with Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC).  The 
original intent of CPMS was to: 

  Manage project data and schedules 
  Develop the draft CTP and final CTP 
  Create the quarterly CWS 
  Perform quarterly Federal Aid assumption analysis 
  Forecast project cash flows 
  Move data to and from other non-CPMS systems 

Each mode is assigned a Microsoft Access Database and related utilities.  The mode is responsible to 
input project data and cash flow information into the database each quarter.  The mode saves the data 
and provides MDOT HQ with a copy of the saved database file.  MDOT HQ manually uploads the 
database file into the MDOT HQ CPMS Application (access database).  MDOT HQ reviews the mode 
information and creates a CWS, a draft CTP, and / or a final CTP.

1.4  Reason for Project & Project Methodology 

CPMS was originally developed in the early 2000’s.  Recent years various modifications and upgrades 
have provided temporary solutions to the growing need for a more robust and modern platform to 
manage the transportation capital program.  MDOT is experiencing various technical glitches due to 
Microsoft Access software upgrades.  Additionally, MDOT experienced difficulty finding contract support 
to maintain this legacy system.  These growing issues have compromised the functionality and reliability 
of the system. 

Initially, a case study was requested.  The case study was to explore in detail the current CPMS 
environment and based on findings suggest possible strategies to either retain the current system, 
modify the current system, and / or replace the current system.  MDOT engaged Infojini (contractor) to 
provide a business analyst to create a case study.   

At the start of the project, MDOT HQ leadership determined that a case study was not needed to 
explore the current CPMS environment.  MDOT HQ leadership reasoned they already understood that 
retaining or modifying the current system would not be viable solutions.  This reasoning was explained 
because Microsoft Access was already determined to be an inadequate structure for their ongoing and 
future needs.  MDOT HQ leadership and the contractor agreed to modify the project deliverable from a 
case study to a Business Requirements Document (BRD).   

pg. 6 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CPMS  
Business Requirements Document (BRD) 

A BRD provides each stakeholder the opportunity to indicate how they currently use CPMS.  The BRD 
captures future system requirements suggested by stakeholders.  The CPMS BRD will provide future 
analysts, project managers, and developers with a path to follow when organizing development efforts.  

The contractor used the following strategies to create the CPMS BRD and communicate project updates: 

  Researched existing systems 
  Researched possible vendors 
  Reviewed existing CPMS documentation 
  Reviewed current CPMS functionality 
  Arranged meetings to document stakeholder current CPMS usage 
  Arranged meetings to document stakeholder future CPMS business requirements 
  Provided CPMS project owners with weekly project updates 
  Facilitated formal and informal project update meetings 

Before the end of the project MDOT HQ requested the contractor to add case study elements into the 
CPMS BRD.  The final deliverable is a hybrid document that provides some case study elements and BRD 
elements.    

The contractor suggests government organizations who consider new system development use the 
following steps: 

1.  Conduct internal formal and informal information gathering / sharing discussions regarding the 

current system 

2.  Perform business process modeling efforts for those areas / individuals who contribute to the 

current system and / or depend on information from the current system 

3.  Engage Procurement to determine appropriate vehicles for any anticipated vendor engagement 

if internal skill set is not available 

4.  Conduct a formal case study and / or formal needs analysis 
5.  Create a BRD written with a development audience in mind that captures the current state and 
captures future business requirements (the document should focus on what the business would 
like the new system to do not how the system should do it)  

7. 

6.  Send the BRD out to external vendors and to internal IT groups for request for information and / 
or request for quote (the deliverable should indicate what technologies the organization will use 
to develop the new system and general costs estimates that include when appropriate, 
hardware, software, server(s), customized development, project oversight, etc.) 
If appropriate send out for request for proposal requesting awarded vendor to provide the 
following deliverables:  functional requirements document, technical specifications document, 
system development, periodic system demo’s, system technical QA, system User Acceptance 
Testing, system roll out to production plan, system documentation, user system training 
materials, and if appropriate system maintenance plan

3.0 RISK ASSESSMENT 

The Department of Transportation Secretary’s Office Audit Report dated November 2012 cited the 
following CPMS risks: 

  MDOT had not established adequate procedures to verify the accuracy of expenditure and 

estimated cost data recorded in CPMS by MDOT’s modals to help ensure the reliability of data 
used for decision making purposes. 

  Access to CPMS was not adequately documented or monitored as there was no formal process 

for documenting user access requests and approvals. 

The contractor, MDOT Audit, and MDOT HQ indicate the following risks: 

  Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) Office of Planning & Capital Programming 
(OPCP) inexperience in the management of IT system contracts.  OPCP is a transportation 
planning and programming office and lacks the necessary expertise to continue the 
management of IT systems. 

  CPMS is not integrated into MDOT HQ systems or modal administration systems.  As a result, 

there is often conflicting capital program information between the modal databases, the various 
MDOT CPMS modules, and other financial systems.    

4.0 ASSUMPTIONS 

Section 6.1.1 Statement of Business Requirements contains duplicate business requirements under the 
‘Business Requirements Detail’ area.  Many of the modal administrations and MDOT HQ suggested 
similar business requirements.   

5.0 STATEMENT OF BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS 
5.1  Background 

Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) created CPMS for the Maryland Department of Transportation 
(MDOT) Office of Planning & Capital Programming.  CSC developed CPMS to: 

  Manage project data and schedules 
  Develop the draft CTP and final CTP 
  Create the quarterly CWS 
  Perform quarterly Federal Aid assumption analysis 
  Forecast project cash flows 
  Move date to and from other non-CPMS systems 

CSC provides system maintenance and programs new system updates.  MDOT and each mode has the 
ability to request CSC to perform system fixes and upgrades.   

CSC defined CPMS as a core system with customized subsystems.

Initially, CSC created 4 distinct CPMS modules and describes them in the following manner: 

MDOT CPMS - consists of 1 Headquarters CPMS application, 1 version update utility, and 1 Ad Hoc 
subsystem. 
MTA CPMS – consists of 1 MTA CPMS application, 1 version update utility, 1 Ad Hoc subsystem, 1 
quarterly snapshot subsystem, 1 analyze subsystem, and 1 import FA subsystem. 
SHA CPMS – consists of 1 SHA CPMS application, 1 version update utility, 1 Ad Hoc subsystem. 
Generic CPMS – consists of 1 generic CPMS application, 1 version update utility, 1 Ad Hoc subsystem, 1 
quarterly snapshot subsystem. 

CSC created the Generic CPMS application for use by all modes except MTA and SHA.  Generic CPMS 
versions were later transitioned into specific CPMS modules for MDTA, and MVA.   

CSC created and describes these updated generic CPMS modules in the following manner: 

MDTA – consists of 1 generic CPMS application, 1 generic version update utility, 1 customized Ad Hoc 
subsystem, 1 generic quarterly snapshot subsystem. 
MVA - consists of 1 generic CPMS application, 1 generic CPMS application used for CTIPP data, 1 generic 
version update utility, 1 generic Ad Hoc subsystem, 1 generic quarterly snapshot subsystem. 

5.2  Current Environment 

CPMS is a data input and reporting tool.  However, many transportation modes use CPMS for the day-to-
day management of their capital program to monitor and track project status and schedules. 

Currently, each modal administration (except WMATA) is assigned a CPMS Module.  Each mode is 
responsible to input project data and cash flow information into their CPMS Application (access

database) each quarter.  The mode saves their data and then manually provides MDOT HQ with a copy 
of the saved database file.  MDOT HQ manually uploads the database file into the MDOT HQ CPMS 
Application (access database).   

Depending on the quarter, MDOT HQ prepares the following: 

  A quarterly Comprehensive Work Schedule (CWS) document 
  A 1st quarter draft Consolidated Transportation Program (CTP) report  
  A 3rd quarter final Consolidated Transportation Program (CTP) report

MDOT HQ manually inputs WMATA CWS, Draft CTP, and Final CTP data into the MDOT HQ CPMS 
Application.   

Additionally, the MDOT IT Group maintains Oracle Servers and has an employee knowledge base related 
to Oracle servers and databases.   

5.2.1  Transportation Mode CWS, Draft CTP & Final CTP Preparation 

Each mode prepares information to be included in the MDOT HQ deliverables: quarterly CWS, the draft 
CTP, and the final CTP.   

5.2.1.1  MPA General Process & Sub Process Identification 

MPA inputs data manually into CPMS on a quarterly basis.  Several MPA data sources contribute to the 
information needed for the CWS, draft CTP, and final CTP.  Many of the data sources consists of MPA 
specific internal steps (sub processes).  These sub processes are not specific to the MDOT HQ CPMS 
general process.  However, the MPA sub processes may benefit by being explored in future CPMS 
development efforts.

  PM sends Project Form 42 for approval 
 

If approval provided, PM will use the same form to request additional funding for other project 
phases (PE, Construction, etc.). Project Form 42 is an iterative process.   

  Data from the approved form is moved into CFS and a request is made to add data into FMIS 

(Form 30).  FMIS does not capture all Project Form 42 data only the elements relevant that allow 
SHA to administer payments through CFS.  CFS does not capture and / or use all Project Form 42 
data.  However, detailed Project Form 42 data is placed into the Financial Advertisement 
Schedule.  This spreadsheet captures System Preservation individual project details, 
advertisement data, and later phases of the project).   

  The Financial Advertisement Schedule (detail view) is made available to internal SHA and MDOT 

personnel.  Summary only views are shared with the public, consultants, etc.   

  SHA works with their PMs and Fund Managers to gather cash flow information related to the 

identified master fund.  This roll up data (fund data) is contained in an internal SHA spreadsheet 
where federal and state split percentages are manipulated. 

  Fund data is moved to the SHA Database (Minor & System Preservation Projects). 
  The SHA Database information is then moved to CPMS (Refer to the SHA CPMS CWS and CTP 

steps). 

In addition to providing CWS and CTP information, every 2nd quarter SHA reconciles the dollars budgeted 
to the dollars spent (sub process).

CPMS  
Business Requirements Document (BRD) 

The preparation of the 1st Quarter Draft CTP Report and the 3rd Quarter Final CTP Report picks up from 
the CWS process.  The additional steps incorporate the preparation of the draft and / or final CTP, the 
printing of the CTP, and senior leadership review meetings.  The steps to prepare the draft and / or final 
CTP for printing are manual, extremely time consuming, and require the repetitive entry of redundant 
information.   

Additional Steps 

  Review PIF information (review system generated reports) compare against CWS and vet with 

mode(s) if necessary 

  Review Minor information (review system generated reports) compare against CWS and vet with 

mode(s) if necessary 

  MDOT HQ Analyst alerts the MDOT Regional Planning & Capital Programming, Assistant Director the 

CTP data is reviewed 

  The Assistant Director makes comments on the hardcopy documents and meets with his team 

 

members, when appropriate 
If simple adjustments are needed, the Assistant Director will update the data  and / or spreadsheet 
(if large adjustments are needed the Assistant Director will ask the analyst to perform the update) 
  The Assistant Director reviews and / or prepares the CTP Introduction Section (the Introduction of 
the CTP report is written in voice of Secretary of Transportation and sets the direction for CTP) 
  Additional budget reports, charts, financial tables, and diagrams are generated by CPMS and various 

modal and HQ sources.  These items are often uploaded and / or manually input into the 
appropriate CPMS areas and / or external spreadsheets. 

  The Assistant Director has to manually prepare the CTP for printing by compiling and formatting the 

various report sections. 

  Once the Assistant Director is comfortable with the CTP document his team will meet with senior 

leadership, and other interested parties (if appropriate).  The team will provide a sample 
presentation and feedback will be gathered from senior leaders.   

  The team members and senior leadership will meet with Finance to go over the presentation.  The 
Assistant Director will lead the discussion if Finance has any questions and provide follow up after 
the meeting, if needed.  This meeting is considered a dry run before the secretary’s meeting.   

  The team and senior leadership meet with the Secretary. 
  No sign offs are required from the Secretary.  
  Stakeholders receive hard copies and / or electronic versions 
 

Later if addendums are needed, the online CTP report is adjusted.  In this instance, the printed CTP 
report may not be the same as the online document. 

5.3  Relevant Business Problems 

Each modes uses CPMS to provide the standard deliverables (CWS, draft / final CTP) to MDOT 
Headquarters (HQ).  However, many modes have the need to use CPMS in a more robust manner to 
connect with other data sources and to manage their capital program on a daily basis.  These needs may 
not necessarily coincide with MDOT needs but are important and specific to the mode. (Refer to Mode 
Current Environment and Business Requirements Sections). 

pg. 31 

 
 
 
CPMS  
Business Requirements Document (BRD) 

CPMS does not address all reporting needs.  Most modes provide additional reports in addition to their 
quarterly CPMS submission. (Refer to Resources Section) 

CPMS functionality is comprised when Microsoft Access releases a new version. 

CSC contractor is retiring and no current institutional programming knowledge exists. 

CSC programmed CPMS to perform the following functions: 

  Manage project data and schedules 
  Develop the draft CTP and final CTP 
  Create the quarterly CWS 
  Perform quarterly Federal Aid assumption analysis 
  Forecast project cash flows 
  Move data to and from other non-CPMS systems 

However, the current CPMS modules do not: 

  Accurately, manage project data and schedules in a manner consistent with project 

management standards. 

  Accurately, perform quarterly Federal Aid assumption analysis for those modes who need this 

information. 

  Seamlessly create draft CTP and final CTPs without extensive manual manipulation and external 

input / reporting. 

  Seamlessly create quarterly CWSs without extensive manual manipulation and external input /

5.6  Limitations, Constraints, and / or Dependencies 

  CPMS project funding – MDOT may not have the funding to create a new CPMS application. 
  Mode Subject Matter Expert (SME) availability – Modes may not have time to provide personnel 

to assist with the project. 

  Future CPMS responsibility and maintenance – Will the new CPMS application be supported by 

vendors and / or internal IT resources. 

  Application and server capacity – Where will the new CPMS application be housed if on internal 

server or servers will they be able to handle the number of hits (demands) from users who are 
simultaneously inputting and extracting data. 

  Currently MDOT IT Group supports Oracle environment – Any new development will need to be 
aware of the current system environment to ensure new products are compatible with the 
current environment. 

  The inability to gather project specific information from modes may require business process 

adjustments and may not be resolved by a system fix. 

5.7  Definition of Completion 

Will be determined in future Functional Requirements Document and / or future Technical Specification 
Document.

There is a need for new internal policies on inputting and maintaining data so all 
modes are providing the information in a consistent manner.

There should be some discussion on re-organizing project data and how it is 
presented in the system.   Is the way we program project information the most 
effective and usable?

The ability to view SHA project specific information 
The system should provide various automated quality control checks and 
error messages to ensure project data is consistent and complete across 
system functions and reports. 
Ability for system to log and track system maintenance items.  

Would like modes to use the appropriate CPMS system tools correctly   

Develop a universal project coding description methodology that can be used by 
all modes.  This will effective tracking and descriptions of projects. 

Consider using work days in addition to $$’s 
The ability for the system to calculate a priority rating for each project 
based off weighted factors and goals met.  In addition, system should 
also have the ability to develop budget scenarios based off those priority 
ratings.  
Would like to incorporate Life Cycle Analysis, would like to see CPMS encompass 
outside 6 years now only does 6 years – if can do this can link to life cycle 
analysis that is currently owned by engineering, which is based off inspection 
reports would like the ability to rank projects 

MDOT Finance  Expand types of funds to include reimbursable funds 

DLS 

Public Private Partnerships – the PIF sheets do not show all active capital 
spending need to see what the private partner is budgeting for construction, 
etc. – possibly may need to see actual costs (this may not be important) 

MDOT Audit 

Business needs to determine critical data entry fields that should be monitored 
if they are altered 

MVA

Need new phase descriptions for IT projects – should follow true software 
development life cycle (SDLC) phases 

Go beyond standard 6 years (forecast) 
Capture true costs of project (example:  allocate employee costs against 
projects, overheads, etc.) – this would give a better understanding of true 
project costs 

Ability to capture jobs created because of the project (needed for all modes).  
Example – this project created this many jobs and contributed to the economic 
impact to XYZ local businesses.

The ability to drill down to sub-project details.  This is especially the case with 
SHA, as they often use the System Preservation Project as a catch all for many 
small minor projects.  MTA also lumps their LOTS program funding into one 
project which does not provide individual county breakdowns of funding.  The 
ability to breakdown some of these sub-projects for funding, facility, and 
location information is needed.  There was also some discussion on the ability to 
program multiple project phases of under the same project rather than 
separating them out as individual projects.  This is more pertinent to large multi-
phase projects. 

The ability for the system to export data report data into excel is important.  The 
system currently only exports as a PDF or Word document.  To analyze the data 
it needs to be in excel format.  Currently staff have to manually type project 
information into an excel workbook.  

The ability for the new system to auto-generate the CWS Quarterly Review 
Report would be very valuable.  This is currently created outside the system in a 
series of excel workbooks that are manually populated. 

The ability to auto-generate Attachment As would be valuable too. This is 
currently produced through a workbook outside the system by manual input of 
data. 

Analysis queries could prove to be beneficial too.  For example, reports that can 
generate variance analysis in which cash flow changes are over a certain dollar 
figure would be helpful. 

There should be the ability to have a live feed to import expenditure data.  FMIS 
is the MDOT’s accounting system that should be interfaced.  MDTA and SHA also 
have external expenditure systems that they will probably want to interface 
with a CPMS replacement.

A % Project Completion field may be helpful to capture in the new system.

Some sort of ‘Flag’ ability to call out projects of similar types across modes could 
be helpful for running queries. 

It may be beneficial to also enable summary fields to explain major project 
changes from quarter to quarter cash flows. 

Should see all projects (with criteria to adjust) understanding what project 
belongs to what in specific detail 

New system needs to coordinate and include STIP and TIP process 
Provide year by year expenditure date needed – wants to run a report where 
you can see expenditures by year, by quarter, by month, by day, etc. and by 
other parameters should be adjustable (menu driven – dashboard) 

Automate CWS process (allow customized text entry and also intuitive thinking 
that indicates what happened and why) Example: 1mill moved to new year and 
system could indicate $ moved to new year 

Allow modes to select reason for variance and provide HQ ability to input 
custom text to discuss reason for variance 

Variance analysis – would like to see major increases and why – based on $ 
threshold

Ability to download checkbook data directly into new CPMS. Note: MAA’s 
Checkbook data is the accounting system used to track expenditures of their 
“Other” funds (i.e. PFC, CFC, etc.) 

Believes CPMS should be a full forecast / actual tool that allows user to: 
maintain and create an inventory (long range planning) 1 – 20+ years of data of 
asset and engineering data to forecast budgets, identify projects available for 
alternative funding sources, project prioritization, determine what can be 
funded, what could be put on hold, trigger project phases, allow projections and 
actuals. 

Ability to adjust project funding logic to fit needs at any time – leave state open 
for adjustment (currently state is static and does not allow manipulation) 
Identify fund type and grant type (this requirement may also relate to STIP/TIPP 
and the obligation of funds) 

System should track project funding with their associated contract(s) #s.   
Reporting functions should enable the query of all projects funded under 
a specific contract – a contract may fund several different projects.

flow – also need to track re-obligation – need to know separations of $$ what is 
being spent when (track color of $$) – currently getting funds from a number of 
sources grants, sub grants, (revenue sources)  - allocations should be based on 
different business rules.  This need may mean:  Track project Federal funding 
down to the appropriation year and obligation year to meet TIP/STIP reporting 
process.  The system should also track re-obligated federal funds to determine 
the history of how these funds have been programmed.

The system should be web-based to enable multi-modal system used by all 
agencies anywhere.   The ability to work off the same live data is important.  To 
meet some of the modal needs it may be necessary to have a planning module 
where projects are created and preliminary imputed and then a programming 
module where planning information is submitted to be final programmed 
request/data. 

HQ functions should have access to all modes whereas each modal agency 
should only have access to their data. 

Ability to have multiple CPMS sessions loaded and available for real time input 
and viewing for all users 

Possible fund manager direct input (this may be needed in future) 
Provide WMATA Liaison with access to CPMS 
Need to meet the STATE and MDOT Security Policies as they relate to 
password complexity and retention 
There needs to be more robust user-friendly reporting functions.  There is little 
flexibility in the current caned reporting tools and unless you know Access there 
is limited ability to create your own reports.  This is because many of the data 
field names are not intuitive on what they populate as well as the user friendly 
issues with Access. 

The system presentation and tool menus are not the most efficient.  As they are 
not organized in a logical flow or function way.  For example, menu bars could 
be separated by task – CWS Review, CTP Development, Etc.  Currently they are 
spread out among the different menu bars requiring you to move in and out 
different menus. 

Each modal administration should have a customized user interface that 
meets their specific data entry and programming needs.  (already 
mentioned) 

Make web enabled – where modes could access via intranet, etc. 

Need simple way to pull reports – make user friendly (make a reporting 
dashboard available for canned reports)

1.  Engage Procurement to determine appropriate vehicles for any anticipated vendor engagement 

if internal skill set is not available 

2.  Send the BRD out to external vendors and to internal IT groups for request for information and / 
or request for quote (the deliverable should indicate what technologies the organization will use 
to develop the new system and general costs estimates that include when appropriate, 
hardware, software, server(s), customized development, project oversight, etc.)

6.3  Other Options Considered  

  Do nothing – retain existing CPMS Microsoft Access databases and functionality 
  Retain the existing CPMS Microsoft Access databases and functionality and build a Reporting 

Tool 

7.0 IMAPCT URGENCY 

CPMS has reached the end of its useful life.  The system is currently operating with a series of temporary 
fixes and solutions that do not provide the diverse functionality needed to manage the complex MDOT 
Capital Program.  Capital programming staff are required to dedicate an enormous amount of time and 
resources to managing and reporting on the program through various ad hoc excel spreadsheets, 
manual analysis, and manual data entry.  

Additionally, CPMS loses some functionality with each Microsoft Access software update.  The 
functionality is lost because either the function can no longer be programmed in the new software 
upgrade or programming support with the skill set required is not available.    

These issues compromise MDOT’s ability to effectively administer the MDOT Capital Program.
